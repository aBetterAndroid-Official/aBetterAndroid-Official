Welcome to aBetterAndroid Official Github Repository;
We're looking for people interested in getting in or contributing for a better Android user experience (battery life,privacy,ads,smoothness,looks,etc);
We already have some apps ready to be pubished but we want them to be fully completed and easy to use.
